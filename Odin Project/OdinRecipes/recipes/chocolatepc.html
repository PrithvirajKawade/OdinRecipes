    <h2>
        Description
    </h2>
    <div>This is my go-to recipe for chocolate chip pancakes. The pancakes come out super fluffy and the whole family
        loves
        them. Add as many chocolate chips as you like. Can easily be doubled or tripled. Serve with maple syrup if you
        like.
    </div>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps To Create</h2>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to "sour" the milk. You are essentially
                making your own buttermilk with this step.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into "soured" milk until well combined. Pour flour mixture into
                the
                wet
                ingredients and whisk until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Batter will be thick. Allow batter
                to
                rest
                for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour about ¼ cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface,
                2 to
                4
                minutes. Flip pancake with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes.
                Repeat
                with
                remaining batter. Serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
