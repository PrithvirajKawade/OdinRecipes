    <h2>
        Description
    </h2>
    <div>Cheesy, pepperoni-topped pizzas with a crispy, chewy crust. The homemade dough is inspired by the famous
        2-ingredient pizza doughs, with just a few more ingredients to add better flavor, and it's ready to top and bake
        in just 10 minutes.
    </div>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups self-rising flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps To Create</h2>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>

                Mix 2 cups self-rising flour, sugar, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for dough in a bowl until well
                combined. Add olive oil and Greek yogurt and mix with a spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Clean off the
                spoon and mix the dough with your hands until it mostly comes together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer dough to a work surface and continue pushing it together until it smooths out. It will be dry;
                don't be tempted yet to add more liquid. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 3 to 4 minutes, only
                adding a teaspoon or two of water or flour if absolutely necessary. Cut dough into two equal pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle 1 tablespoon cornmeal over the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll one piece dough on a lightly floured surface to an 1/8-inch-thick rectangle. Transfer to the
                prepared baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top dough with ½ of the pizza sauce, spreading it almost, but not quite all the way, to the edges.
                Sprinkle ½ of the mozzarella over the sauce, then ½ of the Parmigiano-Reggiano over top. Arrange ½ of
                the pepperoni slices over the cheese, then drizzle 1 teaspoon oil over top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the center of the preheated oven until crust is beautifully browned and toppings are bubbly,
                about 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let sit for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
            </li>
            <li>
                As soon as you remove the pizza from the oven, repeat Steps 3 to 6 to top and bake second pizza.
            </li>
        </ol>
